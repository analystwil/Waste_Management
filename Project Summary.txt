Outline of the Project should be first in the Read.Me file
Outline should include items below:
•	Business Problem and Questions
•	Data Sources
•	Model
•	Database & Dashboard we selected
•		
Go into detail about the items below:
•	Database we are using, how we will access the data
•	How many observations? (Rows in the file – 54,000 data points)
o	Mention we didn’t have to do any cleaning of the data, it was intact already
o	5 features (columns – ex. Weight, data and etc.)
•	Add legend to presentation
o	Go into detail about what the data in the columns mean
o	
Next Steps should be at the bottom of Read.Me or Word document
We don’t need to speak on data processing unless we had to clean up the data
